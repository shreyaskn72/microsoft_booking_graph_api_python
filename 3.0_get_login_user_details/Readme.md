### Description

This function retrieves user information from the Microsoft Graph API using a valid OAuth 2.0 access token.

Here's a detailed explanation of the typical response from the `https://graph.microsoft.com/oidc/userinfo` endpoint, along with the structure and meaning of the response fields:

### Response Structure

When you successfully call the `get_logged_in_user_details` function, the response from the Microsoft Graph API will generally be a JSON object containing user claims. Hereâ€™s an example response and its explanation:

```json

    "preferred_username": "johndoe@example.com",
    "given_name": "John",
    "family_name": "Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "groups": [
        "group1",
        "group2"
    ],
    "upn": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

### Response Fields Explained

- **`sub`**: (string) The unique identifier for the user in the directory. This is typically used as the subject identifier.

- **`name`**: (string) The full name of the user as displayed in the directory.

### Error Responses

If there is an error, the API will typically return a response with a status code other than 200. The error response may look like this:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "InvalidAuthenticationToken",
        "message": "Access token is invalid.",
        "innerError": {
            "request-id": "abcdefgh-ijkl-mnop-qrst-uvwxyz123456",
            "date": "2024-11-04T12:00:00"
        }
